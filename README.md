# Deeplearning.ai
Here are some of the assignments of the course in deeplearning.ai.

## November 23rd
I decide to restart my deep learning course. I paused it due to the TOEFL exam, and now, I got some time to restart it.
After last phase, I have finished the 2 courses' assignments, and I upload it to this project. 
And today, I finished the 3rd course, and I'm writing some note. I will upload the notes too when I finish all of the class

## November 25th
I finished the course 4, convolutional nerual network, week 1 and finished the assignment both based on Tensorflow and Numpy.
I have uploaded the assignment.

## November 27th
Actually, I finished courese yesterday, but the assignments was finish today. I learned how to use keras to build up my convolutional nerual network and I tried to estabulish a ResNet follow the Ng's instruction. I will finish the week 3's lecture this afternoon 

## November 28th
Finished the week3's study today about the image classification and localization. Uploaded the assignments this afternoon.
The test process of YOLO algorithm cannot work well due to the absence of a model file, I'm not sure why it is missed, and cannot find another one to replace it. But I think I already know the basic idea of YOLO. Good luck for the following study
