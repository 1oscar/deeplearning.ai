# Deeplearning.ai
Here are some of the assignments of the course in deeplearning.ai.

## November 23rd
I decide to restart my deep learning course. I paused it due to the TOEFL exam, and now, I got some time to restart it.
After last phase, I have finished the 2 courses' assignments, and I upload it to this project. 
And today, I finished the 3rd course, and I'm writing some note. I will upload the notes too when I finish all of the class

## November 25th
I finished the course 4, convolutional nerual network, week 1 and finished the assignment both based on Tensorflow and Numpy.
I have uploaded the assignment.

## November 27th
Actually, I finished courese yesterday, but the assignments was finish today. I learned how to use keras to build up my convolutional nerual network and I tried to estabulish a ResNet follow the Ng's instruction. I will finish the week 3's lecture this afternoon
